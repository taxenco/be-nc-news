# Northcoders News API

The project consists of a JavaScript API to use in the NorthCoders Front End Module. The API performs a migration and runs a seed function to insert the appropriate
data into a database by using Knex. Besides, the API contains several endpoints, which could be used by the client to make a request, update, post and delete information. Finally, the API is hosted using Heroku.

# Getting Started

* Download [https://code.visualstudio.com/] or another alternative source-code editor of your preference
